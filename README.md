# Pytorch-StNet-Full-Implement
This is a full implement of StNet based on the work of hyperfraise  https://github.com/hyperfraise/Pytorch-StNet. Thanks for the great job of hyperfraise!

The data set I use in trainning is UCF-101 https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/research/data-sets/human-actions/ucf101/

The StNet is proposed by https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.01549.pdf
 
The rsults seem not correspond to the paper. I will try to fix this repositories.
